    <h1>seven drunken nights</h1>
    <h2>the Dubliners</h2>


    <div>As I went home on Monday night as drunk as drunk could be<br>
        I saw a horse outside the door where my old horse should be<br>
        Well, I called me wife and I said to her, <span>"Will you kindly tell to me"</span><br>
        "Who owns that horse outside the door where my old horse should be?"</div>
    <br>
    <div><i>Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk<br>
        You silly old fellow, still you can not see<br>
        That's a lovely sow that me mother sent to me<br>
        Well, it's many a day I've travelled a hundred miles or more<br>
        But a saddle on a sow sure I never saw before</i></div>
        <br>
    <div>And as I went home on Tuesday night as drunk as drunk could be<br>
        I saw a coat behind the door where my old coat should be<br>
        Well, I called me wife and I said to her, "Will you kindly tell to me"<br>
        "Who owns that coat behind the door where my old coat should be?"</div>
        <br>
    <div><i>Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk<br>
        You silly old fellow, still you can not see<br>
        That's a woollen blanket that me mother sent to me<br>
        Well, it's many a day I've travelled a hundred miles or more<br>
        But buttons in a blanket sure I never saw before</i></div>
        <br>
    <div>And as I went home on Wednesday night as drunk as drunk could be<br>
        I saw a pipe up on the chair where my old pipe should be<br>
        Well, I called me wife and I said to her, "Will you kindly tell to me"<br>
        "Who owns that pipe up on the chair where my old pipe should be?"</div>
        <br>
    <div><i>Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk<br>
        You silly old fellow, still you can not see<br>
        That's a lovely tin whistle that me mother sent to me<br>
        Well, it's many a day I've travelled a hundred miles or more<br>
        But tobacco in a tin whistle sure I never saw before</i></div>
        <br>
    <div>And as I went home on Thursday night as drunk as drunk could be<br>
        I saw two boots beneath the bed where my old boots should be<br>
        Well, I called me wife and I said to her, "Will you kindly tell to me"<br>
        "Who owns them boots beneath the bed where my old boots should be?"</div>
        <br>
    <div><i>Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk<br>
        You silly old fellow, still you can not see<br>
        They're two lovely Geranium pots me mother sent to me<br>
        Well, it's many a day I've travelled a hundred miles or more<br>
        But laces in Geranium pots I never saw before</i></div>
        <br>
    <div>And as I went home on Friday night as drunk as drunk could be<br>
        I saw a head upon the bed where my old head should be<br>
        Well, I called me wife and I said to her, "Will you kindly tell to me"<br>
        "Who owns that head upon the bed where my old head should be?"</div>
        <br>
    <div><i>Ah, you're drunk, you're drunk<br>
        You silly old fellow, still you can not see<br>
        That's a baby boy that me mother sent to me<br>
